* Level 1: Hangar · /Introduction/

#+begin_quote
    Welcome to Doom, soldier. Now shut up and start +fighting+ coding because
    there's no time to waste!
#+end_quote

Welcome again! This is my personal Emacs configuration for the [[https://github.com/doomemacs/doomemacs][Doom Emacs]]
framework. In this ~config.org~ file lies most of my Emacs config. This is a
literate configuration, meaning the code that I stole from more competent
persons than myself will be generated to a nice Emacs config.

Why literate? Well, this allows me to have a nicely organized configuration with
lots of comments, which helps to give a false sense of order and quality.

Oh yeah, I almost forgot. The mandatory _disclaimer_:

If, by any chance, someone other than me stumble across this repository. *BEWARE*.
- I mostly don't know what I am doing.
- I don't understand ~emacs lisp~ very well, nor any intricacies of Emacs, such as load
  order and so on.
- I might be doing stuff incredibly wrong, which might cause you to experience:
  /itching/, /headache/, /internal bleeding/, /raise your taxes/ and /kill your cat…/ to
  name a few. So again, *BEWARE*.

** Before we start

What better way to kick off this configuration than putting a line of code that
I have no idea what it does? Apparently it helps things run faster, me like
fast.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;;; $DOOMDIR/config.el -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-
#+end_src

** How is this config organized?

Well, here's a good question. I didn't really think this through…

The general idea is to organize the packages' configurations in their own
subheading (see [[* Level 5: Phobos Lab · /Packages/][Level 5]]).

Also if ~Doom~ already configures a package in a module, we extend that package
configuration in a subheading that represents the module it originates from (it's
in [[* Level 4: Command Control · /Doom, but it's _my_ personal hell/][Level 4]]).

In [[* Level 6: Central Processing · /Lang stuff/][Level 6]], I put language specific bits of configuration or helpful functions.

** Inspirations

Here's a non exhaustive list of config that helped me write this one. Thanks to
the authors🙏.

* Level 3: Toxin Refinery · /Defaults be bad/

This is the customary « /browsing through the game settings to change the default
parameters…/ »

** Optimisations

I found these settings somewhere, they're supposed to help with « /performance/ »,
so it must be good, right?

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle packages.el
(package! gcmh) ;; https://github.com/emacsmirror/gcmh
#+end_src

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq gc-cons-percentage 0.6

(use-package! gcmh
  :config
  (setq gcmh-idle-delay 5
        gcmh-high-cons-threshold (* 100 1024 1024))  ; 100mb
  (gcmh-mode 1))
#+end_src

** Personal =localleader= · I am the captain, now

The =leader= and =localleader= keys are great, but I want my own, this way, I am
sure my key bindings won't interfere with anythings. I chose =SPC ç=, but I might
change it to something else, maybe a dedicated key on my keyboard…

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defvar daf/localleader-key "SPC ç"
  "The localleader prefix key, for major-mode specific commands.")
#+end_src

** There's no escaping ~evil~

Disabling ~evil-escape~, there's no escaping, I tried.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle packages.el
(package! evil-escape :disable t)
#+end_src

** Default Shell

To make ~fish~ happy, I guess.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq-default vterm-shell (executable-find "fish"))
#+end_src

** Unclutter ~which-key~ menus

~which-key~ could be a little tad bit quicker to show up.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq which-key-idle-delay 0.5) ;; I need the help, I really do
#+end_src

I also think that having ~evil-~ appear in so many popups is a bit too verbose,
let’s change that. (credit's due to Tecosaur)

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq which-key-allow-multiple-replacements t)
(after! which-key
  (pushnew!
   which-key-replacement-alist
   '(("" . "\\`+?evil[-:]?\\(?:a-\\)?\\(.*\\)") . (nil . "󰇴-\\1"))
   '(("" . "\\`+?evilem--?motion-\\(.*\\)")     . (nil . "󰱯-\\1"))))
#+end_src

** ~Dired~ when switching project

When switching to project, I'd rather have ~dired~ open to the project's root,
rather than the default ~find-file~ action.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq +workspaces-switch-project-function #'dired)
#+end_src

** Relocate bookmarks and projects

Me dumb, when Emacs broky, me ~rm -rf emacs/.local~. This lead to losing some
useful stuff, like bookmarks and ~projectile~'s known projects, let's put them
elsewhere.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq bookmark-default-file (expand-file-name "local/bookmarks" doom-user-dir)
      projectile-known-projects-file (expand-file-name "local/projectile.projects" doom-user-dir))
#+end_src

** Margin & Smooth scrolling

I often use =zt=, =zz= and =zb= to scroll through my window, this help to keep a tiny
bit of context above and bellow the current line.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq-default scroll-margin 3)
#+end_src

Emacs 29 introduced pixel scrolling. Let's make its V1 single threaded engine

When using ~evil-mode~, you can rebind =v= to ~er/expand-region~, this is super
useful, keep hitting =v= to further expand the selection!

    When using the dashboard, there are often a small number of actions I will take.
    As the dashboard is it's own major mode, there is no need to suffer the tyranny
    of unnecessary keystrokes --- we can simply bind common actions to a single key!

*** Modeline
**** Configuration

What is that little ball in the left bottom doing anyway? Remove it!

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(advice-add #'doom-modeline-segment--modals :override #'ignore)
#+end_src

#+begin_quote
    However, by default red text is used in the modeline, so let’s make that orange

Let's simplify the ~doom-modeline~, since some information will be redundant with
the ~nano-modeline~.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq doom-modeline-position-column-line-format '(""))
#+end_src

Since we have two modelines (we at dafos corporation spare no expense), it would be handy to disable the ~doom-modeline~ via a shortcut =spc tm=.

(map!
 :leader (:prefix ("t" . "toggle")
          :desc "Doom Modeline" "m" #'hide-mode-line-mode))

By default, I want only the ~nano-modeline~ visible. I only need ~doom-modeline~ if
I am in a buffer with lsp enabled.

the ~global-whitespace-mode~ and revert the buffer afterward.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

**** Configuration & Mapping

But not *too* evil, please. Allows to use Emacs default bindings in insert mode.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

When creating window splits, it's nice to jump straight to them.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(after! evil
  (setq evil-split-window-below  t
        evil-vsplit-window-right t))
#+end_src

Save a few key strokes, open up ~dired~ while we're at it.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defadvice! prompt-for-buffer (&rest _)

#+end_src

I like my ~s/../..~ to be global by default.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(after! evil
  (setq evil-ex-substitute-global t))
#+end_src

I use =o=, =O= often, but not much for appending comments, let's disable that.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(after! evil
  (setq +evil-want-o/O-to-continue-comments nil))
#+end_src

FIXME ~evil-surround~ is acting up, refusing to load, and requiring to manually enable.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(after! evil
  (setq global-evil-surround-mode 1))
#+end_src

Habits die hard. I use =q= to close most things. I want to close buffer too. This
means ~macros~ should be mapped to =Q=.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(map!

*** ~dired~ · « Our last resort, in these dire times »
**** TODO Overview
**** Configuration

Open file with external application from ~Dired~.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun daf/dired-open-file ()
  "In Dired, open the file named on this line."
  (interactive)
  (let* ((file (dired-get-filename nil t)))
    (message "Opening %s..." file)
    (call-process "xdg-open" nil 0 nil file)
    (message "Opening %s done" file)))
#+end_src

**** Mapping

Conveniently, Doom doesn't use =SPC d= and I use ~Dired~ often, so let's add a few
key bindings.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(map! :leader
      (:prefix ("d" . "Dired")
       :desc "Dired"                       "." #'dired
       :desc "Dired jump to current"       "d" #'dired-jump
       :desc "fd input to Dired"           "f" #'fd-dired
       :desc "Dired into project root"     "p" #'project-dired
       :desc "Open Dired in another frame" "D" #'dired-other-window))
#+end_src

~dirvish~ makes navigating directories so much pleasant! Let's change a bit of key
bindings.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(after! dired
  (map! :leader
        :prefix ("t" . "toggle")
        :desc "Side bar" :mvn "d" #'dirvish-side)
  (map! :after dirvish
        :map dirvish-mode-map

** Term · ~:term~ inally ill

I still need to learn to *stay* in Emacs when in comes to shell, but luckily we
have ~eshell~ and ~vterm~ for that. I am still undecided between the two, so I use
them both!

*** ~eshell~
**** Configuration

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle packages.el
(package! aweshell
  :recipe (:host github
           :repo "manateelazycat/aweshell")) ;; https://github.com/manateelazycat/aweshel
#+end_src

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package! aweshell
  :defer t
  :commands (aweshell-new aweshell-dedicated-open))
#+end_src

*** ~vterm~
**** Configuration & Mapping

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package! vterm
  :config
  (setf (alist-get "woman" vterm-eval-cmds nil nil #'equal)
        '((lambda (topic)
            (woman topic))))
  (setf (alist-get "magit-status" vterm-eval-cmds nil nil #'equal)
        '((lambda (path)
            (magit-status path))))
  (setf (alist-get "dired" vterm-eval-cmds nil nil #'equal)
        '((lambda (dir)
            (dired dir))))
  (set-popup-rules!
    '(("^\\*doom:vterm.*"

       :actions (+popup-display-buffer-stacked-side-window-fn)
       :side bottom :width 0.5 :height 0.55 :quit 'other :ttl nil))))
#+end_src


I had some visual issue with my default font when rendering some symbols in the
prompt. So lets set a specific font for ~vterm~.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(when (modulep! :term vterm)
  ;; Use monospaced font faces in current buffer
  (defun +vterm-mode-setup ()
    "Sets a fixed width (monospace) font in current buffer"
    (set (make-local-variable 'buffer-face-mode-face)
         '(:family "MonaspiceKr Nerd Font Propo"))
    (face-remap-add-relative 'fixed-pitch)
    (buffer-face-mode t))

  (add-hook 'vterm-mode-hook #'+vterm-mode-setup))
#+end_src

~eshell~ has helpful functions to open a split right and bellow, lets do the same
for ~vterm~.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(when (modulep! :term vterm)
  (defun +vterm/split-right ()
    "Create a new vterm window to the right of the current one."
    (interactive)
    (let* ((ignore-window-parameters t)
           (dedicated-p (window-dedicated-p)))
      (select-window (split-window-horizontally))
      (+vterm/here default-directory)))

  (defun +vterm/split-below ()
    "Create a new vterm window below the current one."
    (interactive)
    (let* ((ignore-window-parameters t)
           (dedicated-p (window-dedicated-p)))
      (select-window (split-window-vertically))
      (+vterm/here default-directory))))
#+end_src

Now lets put all this into a global binding, I'll use =SPC e=.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(map! :leader
      :when (modulep! :term vterm)
      (:prefix ("e" . "(e)shell")
       :desc "toggle eshell popup"           "E" #'+eshell/toggle
       :desc "open eshell here"              "e" #'+eshell/here
       :desc "open eshell in project root"   "p" #'project-eshell
       :desc "eshell below"                  "K" #'+eshell/split-below
       :desc "eshell right"                  "V" #'+eshell/split-right
       :desc "toggle vterm popup"            "T" #'+vterm/toggle
       :desc "open vterm here"               "t" #'+vterm/here
       :desc "vterm below"                   "k" #'+vterm/split-below
       :desc "vterm right"                   "v" #'+vterm/split-right))
#+end_src

    Enable Speed Keys, which allows quick single-key commands when the cursor is

* Level Ⅹ: Sewers · /It never ends…/
« /Confing/ » Emacs is a never ending story. I'll always have stuff to tweak, new
packages to try out, bug or unsatisfactory workflow… I'll try to remember to
reference all that here.

** Known Issues [4/7]

- [X] ~doom-modeline~ isn't happy about font profile switching
- [X] (layout +bepo) isn't working
- [X] (layout +bepo) isn't working, take 2
  I'm still experiencing issues, it seems that when using the ~+bepo~ module,
  ~yas-snipet~ is loaded too often, which cause lags.
- [X] ~company~ glitches with variable fonts (maybe?)
  ~+childframe~ seems to have fixed the issue.
- [ ] emojis and symbols are giving me trouble
  - [ ] can't disable specific symbols
- [ ] ~flycheck~ is activated where it shouldn't
  specifically the ~javascript-eslint~ checker, is activated in buffer (not
  attached to a file) and complains about invalid syntax where it shouldn't. For
  instance when merging javascript/typescript files in ediff, syntax is invalid,
  because of the diff's block, this is expected.
- [ ] ~evil-surround~ needs to be reloaded for keybindings to work.

** Todos [5/6]
- [X] migrate elogcat stuff for android
- [X] finish font setup
  - [X] Iosevka Comfy Wide Duo isn't available on my system
  - [X] setup Overpass font (to try it out)
- [X] add ~nov.el~ maybe a private module?
- [X] add ~verb.el~ maybe a private module?
- [X] setup ~burly.el~
  - [X] bookmarks not persisted
- [ ] try to make a custom function to prompt ~rotate:layout~
  maybe use ~consult--read~ for previewing result?

** Check it out!
- [ ] guess-language.el
- [ ] tempel
- [ ] activities.el
